# benchmarking

Benchmarking various implementations of readers-writer locks, `std::sync::RwLock`, `parking_lot::RwLock`, `tokio::sync::RwLock`.

```
cargo bench --message-format=json > output.json
```

We compare several different Rust implementations of readers-writer locks.

 - [pflock](https://crates.io/crates/pflock), based on "Reader-writer synchronization for shared-memory multiprocessor real-time systems"
 - [pairlock](https://crates.io/crates/pairlock)
 - [tokio](https://tokio.rs/)
 - [sharedmutex](https://crates.io/crates/shared-mutex)
 - [widerwlock](https://crates.io/crates/widerwlock)
 - [spin](https://crates.io/crates/spin)
 - [std::sync::RwLock](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html)

# Concurrency testing

Using the crate `loom` it is actually possible to test all possible
interleavings defined by the C11 memory standard to test the shared lock.

```
RUSTFLAGS="--cfg loom" cargo test
```
